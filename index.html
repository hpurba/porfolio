  <h2>Work Experience:</h2>
  <p>To be honest I don't like working most of the time, but it could be due to some of the jobs I have had. My work experience includes being a caddy for a golf club, packinging boxes for Ralph Lauren, custodian for BYU, and a security guard for the
    MTC. Of all the places I have worked, my favorite has to be custodian with one of my best friends named Colten!</p>
